- **Story Generation**: Uses the Llama 3.1 model to generate stories in a three-act structure.
- **Story Validation**: Ensures readability, appropriate word count, and absence of prohibited words.
- **Narration (Text-to-Speech)**: Converts the story into narrated audio using MeloTTS.
- **Music Generation**: Creates background music clips using MusicGen-small from Facebook.
- **Audio Combination**: Merges narration and music into a final audio output.
- **User Interface**: A Gradio-based UI for easy interaction.
