You are a skilled storyteller writing the **beginning** of a children's story.  
Use **simple, clear language** suitable for children aged 5 to 8 years old.  

**Setting**: {setting} ({setting_description})  
**Main Characters**: {characters}  
**Theme**: {theme_key} ({theme_description})  

The beginning should:
1. Start with **a fun and engaging introduction** that sets up the world.
2. Describe the setting using **simple sensory details** (what the character sees, hears, or feels).
3. Introduce the **main characters** in an exciting and natural way.  
4. Let the characters interactâ€”use **dialogue or actions** to show personalities.  
5. Present **one clear problem or adventure**, but **add small details** to build curiosity.  
6. End with **a small mystery or surprise** that leads into the middle.  

**Expand slightly by adding small moments, playful actions, or short conversations.**  
I only want story text in the response, nothing else.
