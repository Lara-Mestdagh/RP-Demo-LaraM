Write a **happy and satisfying ending** for the children's story.  
Use **short, clear sentences**, but **take a little extra time** to make the ending feel complete.  

**Summary of Beginning**:  
{beginning}  

**Summary of Middle**:  
{middle}  

The ending should:
1. Solve the problem in a **simple and fun way**, but let the characters react.
2. Show how the characters **felt about the adventure** (relief, excitement, pride, etc.).
3. Include **one small extra moment**—a joke, a hug, a short reflection, or a fun twist.
4. Remind the reader of the theme: {theme} **in a way that feels natural**.
5. End with a **happy and warm feeling**—like a bedtime story.

**Take a few extra sentences to describe the final moment in a fun or touching way.**  
I only want story text in the response, nothing else.
